## Overview

This project develops a highly stylized model of an economy with income inequality, where a specified fraction of gross production is allocated to social good. The central question is how to optimally allocate resources between two competing objectives:

1. **Income redistribution** - reducing inequality by transferring income from high-income to low-income individuals
2. **Emissions abatement** - reducing carbon emissions to mitigate future climate damage

The model extends the COIN framework presented in [Caldeira et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acf949) to incorporate income inequality and diminishing marginal utility of income.

For detailed technical documentation, see [README_DETAIL.md](README_DETAIL.md).

## Installation and Requirements

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installing Dependencies

Install all required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages include:
- numpy - numerical computations
- scipy - scientific computing and optimization
- matplotlib - plotting and visualization
- nlopt - nonlinear optimization
- openpyxl - Excel file generation

## Quick Start

### Running a Basic Simulation

Test the model with an example configuration:

```bash
python test_integration.py test_f-f-f-t-t.json
```

This will:
1. Load the configuration
2. Run the forward integration over the specified time period
3. Display results summary
4. Generate timestamped output directory with CSV data and PDF plots

### Running an Optimization

Optimize the allocation between redistribution and abatement:

```bash
python run_optimization.py test_f-f-f-t-t.json
```

This will find the optimal time trajectory of the control variable f(t) (fraction allocated to abatement vs. redistribution) that maximizes the discounted time-integral of aggregate utility.

## Analyzing Results

This section covers tools for post-processing and analyzing optimization results.

### Comparing Multiple Scenarios

Use `compare_results.py` to compare results across multiple optimization runs:

```bash
python compare_results.py "data/output/scenario_*/"
```

The script accepts directory paths or glob patterns and generates:
- `optimization_comparison_summary.xlsx` - Optimization metrics by iteration
- `results_comparison_summary.xlsx` - Time series results for all variables
- `comparison_plots.pdf` - PDF report with comparative visualizations (full time range)
- `comparison_plots_2025-2100.pdf` - PDF report focused on 2025-2100 period

Example comparing specific runs:
```bash
python compare_results.py data/output/config_011_f-f-f-f-f_25_1_100k_el_* data/output/config_011_t-f-t-f-f_25_1_100k_el_*
```

### Analyzing Optimization Convergence

Use `compare_optimization_convergence.py` to analyze how well different optimization runs have converged:

```bash
python compare_optimization_convergence.py
```

This script:
1. Scans `data/output/` for optimization result directories matching specified patterns
2. Loads terminal output to extract final objective values
3. Computes RMS differences in control trajectories (f and s) relative to baseline cases
4. Generates a summary CSV with convergence statistics

The output CSV includes:
- Flag pattern and configuration details
- Objective function values and departure from best result
- RMS differences in f and s trajectories vs. baseline
- Mean, standard deviation, and median of control variables

This is useful for:
- Identifying which runs have converged to similar solutions
- Comparing optimization quality across different configurations
- Detecting outlier runs that may need re-optimization

## Model Overview

### Objective Function

The model optimizes the time-integral of aggregate utility by choosing the allocation fraction f(t) between emissions abatement and income redistribution:

```
max∫₀^∞ e^(-ρt) · U(t) · L(t) dt,  subject to 0 ≤ f(t) ≤ 1
```

where:
- ρ = pure rate of time preference
- U(t) = mean utility of the population at time t
- L(t) = population at time t
- f(t) = fraction of resources allocated to abatement (control variable)

### Core Components

The model combines three subsystems:

1. **Economic Model (Solow-Swan Growth)**
   - Cobb-Douglas production function
   - Capital accumulation with depreciation
   - Climate damage reducing output
   - Income distribution (Pareto-Lorenz or Empirical Lorenz)

2. **Climate Model**
   - Temperature proportional to cumulative emissions
   - Emissions from economic activity
   - Abatement reducing emissions

3. **Utility and Inequality**
   - CRRA (isoelastic) utility function
   - Income-dependent climate damage
   - Redistribution via progressive taxation

#### Empirical Lorenz Formulation

The model supports an empirical Lorenz curve formulation as an alternative to the Pareto-Lorenz distribution. The base empirical Lorenz curve is defined as:

```
L_base(F) = w₀·F^p₀ + w₁·F^p₁ + w₂·F^p₂ + w₃·F^p₃
```

where w₀ = (1 - w₁ - w₂ - w₃), and the parameters are:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| p₀ | 1.500036 |
| w₁ | 0.3776187268483524 |
| p₁ | 4.367440 |
| w₂ | 0.3671247620949191 |
| p₂ | 14.072005 |
| w₃ | 0.09538538350961864 |
| p₃ | 135.059674 |

The base Gini coefficient is computed as:

```
Gini_base = 1 - 2·[w₀/(p₀+1) + w₁/(p₁+1) + w₂/(p₂+1) + w₃/(p₃+1)]
```

To construct a Lorenz curve for an arbitrary Gini coefficient G, we use linear interpolation between perfect equality and the base curve:

```
L(F) = (1 - G/Gini_base)·F + (G/Gini_base)·L_base(F)
```

This formulation is controlled by the `use_empirical_lorenz` boolean parameter in the configuration.

### Key Insights

1. **Redistribution vs. Climate Action Tradeoff**: Resources allocated to income redistribution provide immediate utility gains (especially with high inequality aversion), while emissions abatement provides future benefits by reducing climate damage.

2. **Diminishing Marginal Utility**: Higher values of η (risk aversion) mean that redistributing income from rich to poor has greater utility benefits, favoring redistribution over abatement.

3. **Time Preference**: Higher discount rates (ρ) favor immediate redistribution over long-term climate benefits.

## Basic Usage

### Configuration Files

All model parameters are specified in JSON configuration files. See `test_f-f-f-t-t.json` for an example.

Key configuration sections:
- `scalar_parameters` - Time-invariant constants (α, δ, η, ρ, etc.)
- `time_functions` - Time-dependent functions (A(t), L(t), σ(t), etc.)
- `control_function` - Allocation policy f(t)
- `integration_parameters` - Time span and step size
- `optimization_parameters` - Optimization settings

### Policy Switches

The model has 5 boolean switches controlling different policy features. Three are **primary switches** and two are **sub-switches** that are only meaningful when their parent switch is enabled:

#### Primary Switches

1. **`income_dependent_damage_distribution`** (boolean, default: true)
   - Controls whether climate damage varies by income level
   - When true: Poor people experience higher damage (exponential in income)
   - When false: Everyone experiences the same damage (uniform)
   - Parent switch for: `income_dependent_aggregate_damage`

2. **`income_redistribution`** (boolean, default: true)
   - Controls whether income redistribution is enabled
   - When true: Redistributes from high to low income according to `redistribution_amount`
   - When false: No redistribution occurs
   - Parent switch for: `income_dependent_redistribution_policy`

3. **`income_dependent_tax_policy`** (boolean, default: false)
   - Controls whether taxation is progressive or uniform
   - When true: Progressive tax using `find_Fmax()` to determine tax threshold
   - When false: Uniform tax rate applied to all income

#### Sub-Switches (Only Meaningful with Parent Enabled)

4. **`income_dependent_aggregate_damage`** (boolean, default: true)
   - **Parent switch: `income_dependent_damage_distribution`**
   - **Only meaningful when parent is true**
   - Controls how aggregate damage is calculated when damage varies by income
   - When true: Aggregate damage computed directly from income distribution
   - When false: Rescale damage distribution to match `Omega_base * y_net_aggregate`, where `y_net_aggregate` is mean net income after taxes/transfers
   - Note: When `income_dependent_damage_distribution = false`, damages are naturally proportional to `y_net`, so this flag has no effect
   - Code enforces: Only checked when `income_dependent_damage_distribution` is true

5. **`income_dependent_redistribution_policy`** (boolean, default: false)
   - **Parent switch: `income_redistribution`**
   - **Only meaningful when parent is true**
   - Controls whether redistribution is targeted or uniform
   - When true: Targeted to lowest incomes using `find_Fmin()` to determine threshold
   - When false: Uniform per-capita redistribution to all
   - Code enforces: Only checked when `income_redistribution` is true

**Important**: The code automatically enforces these dependencies. Sub-switches are only evaluated when their parent switch is enabled, ensuring logically consistent behavior.

### Output Files

Each run creates a timestamped directory:
```
./data/output/{run_name}_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/
├── results.csv          # Complete time series data
├── plots.pdf            # Multi-page charts
└── terminal_output.txt  # Console output
```

### Running Multiple Cases in Parallel

Launch multiple optimizations simultaneously:

```bash
python run_parallel.py "config_*.json"
```

Each optimization runs on its own CPU core, with progress logged to `terminal_output.txt` in each output directory.

To override parameters for every launched job, append `--key value` pairs exactly as you would for `run_optimization.py`; dot notation targets nested fields (e.g., `--optimization_params.max_evaluations 100`). Example:

```bash
python run_parallel.py "config_*.json" --optimization_params.max_evaluations 100 --run_name quick_test
```

### Utility Ratio Plots (damage vs. taxation)

Generate a two-panel utility-ratio diagnostic figure:
- **Panel A**: Climate damage utility ratios - comparing income-dependent damage distribution vs. uniform damage (colormap: plasma_r, range: 1.0-3.0)
- **Panel B**: Progressive taxation utility ratios - comparing progressive tax vs. uniform tax (colormap: viridis_r, range: 1.0-10.0)

This creates a timestamped folder under `data/output/` containing a PDF plus optional data exports for both panels:

- PDF only:
   ```bash
   python plot_utility_ratios.py json/config_008_f-t-f-f-f_10_1_1000.json
   ```
- PDF + CSV export for both panels:
   ```bash
   python plot_utility_ratios.py json/config_008_f-t-f-f-f_10_1_1000.json --csv
   ```
- PDF + CSV + XLSX export for both panels (requires pandas):
   ```bash
   python plot_utility_ratios.py json/config_008_f-t-f-f-f_10_1_1000.json --csv --xlsx
   ```

Notes:
- Panel A holds aggregate damage fixed and compares how redistributing the same total damage across incomes affects utility
- Panel B compares utility under progressive taxation (taxing only highest earners) vs. uniform taxation
- All utility ratios are computed relative to the no-tax/uniform-damage baseline
- All output files (PDF, CSV, XLSX) are written to a timestamped directory alongside terminal output

All overrides are applied to every configuration file matched by the patterns.

### Testing Policy Flag Independence

The model includes test scripts to verify that different policy flag combinations produce identical climate and economic outcomes when using the same control trajectories (f and s). This validates that aggregate climate-economy dynamics are independent of distributional policy choices.

#### test_all_flag_variants.py

Test all 16 variants of the *-f-*-*-* flag pattern (fixing `income_dependent_aggregate_damage` to false):

```bash
python test_all_flag_variants.py data/output/config_010_f-f-f-f-f_10_0.02_1000_el_20260106-070053
```

This script:
1. Loads optimized control trajectories (f and s) from the base directory
2. Runs 16 flag combinations (2^4 variants):
   - Position 1: `income_dependent_damage_distribution` (varies)
   - Position 2: `income_dependent_aggregate_damage` (fixed to false)
   - Position 3: `income_dependent_tax_policy` (varies)
   - Position 4: `income_redistribution` (varies)
   - Position 5: `income_dependent_redistribution_policy` (varies)
3. Compares results across all variants

**Expected outcomes**:
- **Climate and economic variables** should be identical (within ~1e-6 relative tolerance)
  - Capital (K), Output (Y_gross, Y_net), Consumption, Savings, Emissions (E), Temperature (delta_T)
  - Small differences (<0.0002%) arise from O(dt) numerical coupling between income and damage distributions
- **Distribution-dependent variables** should differ appropriately
  - Utility (U), Gini coefficients, income rank boundaries (Fmin/Fmax)
  - These differences confirm that policy flags correctly modify distributional outcomes

#### Why Small Differences Occur (O(dt) Coupling)

The lag-1 coupling between income and damage distributions causes tiny differences (~1e-6) in aggregate variables:

At each timestep:
1. Income distribution depends on damage distribution (from previous timestep)
2. Damage distribution depends on income distribution (computed at current timestep)

This circular dependency is broken using a lag-1 approach: damage from timestep t determines income at timestep t+1. Different policy flags → slightly different damage distributions → slightly different capital accumulation over 400 years → tiny drift in emissions and temperature.

These O(dt) differences are:
- **Expected and unavoidable** given the model structure
- **Negligible** compared to parameter uncertainties (6 orders of magnitude smaller)
- **Within acceptable tolerance** for climate-economy models

The test validates that policy choices affect distribution without materially changing aggregate climate-economy outcomes.
